* **Eliminate** unnecessary initiatives, meaningless activity, useless bureaucracy, the wrong people, unproductive meetings and obstacles that are holding your team back. 
* **Automate** regimented tasks, necessary but monotonous work and mechanisms that help reduce “think time” on tasks that are noncreative. 
* **Delegate** work and decision-making authority to the specialized talent you have on your team. As my friend and Multiplier Steve Savage says, “Drive decision making downward.” Purposely enable the vast majority of decisions to be heavily influenced and, hopefully, made by the people who are closest to the front lines. 
* **Procrastinate** on projects that aren’t yet at the “right time” for your organization or anything you aren’t sure is critical to the future direction of the team. 
* **Concentrate** on the next most Significant step for yourself and your organization. Try to create a culture where every task and decision finds the person who is perfectly appropriate for the condition.
